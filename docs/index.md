# terrahelm Provider

**TerraHelm** is a third-party [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) provider that simplifies managing [Helm](https://helm.sh/) releases using [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/) and providing powerful capabilties, like fetching value files from external sources.

### Features:

- Helm CLI Integration: Seamlessly integrates Helm CLI into Terraform, enabling full access to Helm CLI functionalities for improved debugging and operational flexibility.
- Binary Management: Automatically handles the downloading and installation of the specified Helm binary into a cache_dir directory (`.terraform/terrahelm_cache/` by default). This feature supports effortless version management and switching between different Helm versions.
- Flexible Sources: Supports fetching Helm charts and value files from a variety of sources including Git, Mercurial, HTTP, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage. This flexibility ensures easy integration of custom and third-party Helm charts into your Terraform configuration.
- Enhanced Debugging: Provides the capability to execute Helm CLI commands directly, mirroring the operations performed by the provider. This aids in debugging by allowing users to replicate and diagnose issues within the deployment process.
- Customizable Post-Rendering: Seamlessly integrate post-renderers to inject extra configurations or perform manifest transformations before deployment (like secrets rendering).
- Improved Performance: By directly executing Helm commands, TerraHelm minimizes the overhead imposed by Terraform state management logic, leading to faster deploymentsâ€”especially when managing large-scale or multiple Helm charts concurrently.

## Usage Example

```hcl
# install provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    terrahelm = {
      source  = "mikhae1/terrahelm"
    }
  }
}

# setup provider
provider "terrahelm" {
  # install given helm cli version locally into `cache_dir`
  helm_version = "v3.9.4"
  kube_context = "kind"
}

# release helm chart
resource "terrahelm_release" "nginx" {
  name       = "nginx"
  namespace  = "nginx"

  # fetch chart from variety of sources: http::, file::, s3::, gcs::, hg::
  chart_url  = "github.com/mikhae1/terraform-provider-terrahelm//tests/charts/?ref=master&depth=1"
  chart_path = "./nginx"

  # fetch value files from various sources
  values_files = [
    "./values/nginx/common.yaml", # relative to chart directory
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikhae1/terraform-provider-terrahelm/master/tests/charts/values/nginx/dev-values.yaml",
  ]

  # override fetched values from value files
  values = <<EOF
  image:
    tag: "1.25.4
  EOF
}

# retrieve information using data source
data "terrahelm_release" "nginx" {
  name      = "nginx"
  namespace = "nginx"
}
```
